## What is Python?

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is general-purpose, free and open-source programming language for both software developers and researchers.
It is becoming increasingly [popular amongst psychology researchers](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2019/07/python-research), allowing
researchers to create experiments, pre-process and clean data, as well as conduct statistical analyses and graphical visualization.

## Building Experiments

[PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org) is a Python package that has been used amongst psychology and neuroscientists to run cognitive experiments.
Not only does it comprise of a graphical user interface (GUI) so that novices can easily create simple experiments, more advanced customization can be included using Python code.

## Data Wrangling

Base Python consists of a series of modules that accommodates different functionalities. For example, the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) module allows for importing, manipulation and organization of
text files, csv (comma-separated-values) files, or excel spreadsheets. The [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) module is also made for statistical analyses, and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html)
for graphical visualization of data.

## Lab Use

Researchers at Clinical Brain Lab use Python to analyze EEG and physiological (e.g., ECG, EDA, respiration, EMG, EOG) data.
