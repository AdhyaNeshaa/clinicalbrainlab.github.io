## What is fMRI?
fMRI is a safe, noninvasive imaging technology. Unlike x-rays, which use ionizing radiation, fMRI images are generated from a strong magnetic field and low-power radio-waves. 
Therefore, there is no risk of exposure to radiation in fMRI.

## Why use fMRI?
fMRI allows researchers to obtain images of brain activity over time, as participants complete various tasks. 
From these images, researchers get a better understanding of the brain areas that are involved in the tasks.
