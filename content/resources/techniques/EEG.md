## What is EEG?
EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a neuroimaging technique used to measure electrical activity at the scalp that reflects the neural activity in the brain. It is a real-time recording of neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution.

## How is an EEG Done? 

EEG is a completely safe and non-invasive technique. There is no exposure to any form of external x-rays or radiation. To record the EEG signals, an EEG cap would be put over the head and connected to an amplifier which would allow us to see the brain waves on a computer screen. 
Electrolytic gel is inserted into the small plastic holders in the cap to improve the conductance between the electrodes and the scalp. 
Separate electrodes may also be directly attached to the skin (such as above and below the eyes) using electrode tape.

## What is EEG used for?
At the Clinical Brain Lab NTU, we are using EEG to measure changes in brain activity after cognitive training or during cognitive tasks.
