We use a combination of behavioural assessment, neuroimaging techniques, and intervention to investigate the neural reading networks for bilingual readers from a variety of language profiles, across early childhood and adulthood. Our projects aim to identify the critical factors that influence the neurocognitive mechanisms of non-impaired and impaired reading. Our findings will provide implications for neuroscience-informed remediation of reading difficulties to promote effective bilingual and biliteracy development. 

Ongoing projects:
1.	Effective Biliteracy: The Impact of Script Sets on Bilingual Reading Networks for Typical and Atypical Readers (funded by NTU-JHU Collaborative Grant)
2.	Promoting Effective Biliteracy in Early Childhood: A Systematic Screening and Training Programme for Balanced Bilingual Development (funded by Singapore Millennium Foundation) 
3.	NRF Reading Brains project (funded by National Research Foundation)
