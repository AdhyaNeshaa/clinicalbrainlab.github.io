abstract: 'The neuroscience community has widely acknowledged primary motor cortex as a region important for execution of voluntary motor movements. However, the various other roles that this region plays are often underappreciated. Bhattacharjee and colleagues (2020) reviewed studies that used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to examine the primary motor cortex. They highlight that primary motor cortex has additional roles in higher-order cognitive functions related to motor movements, including (i) attention to motor actions, (ii) learning of motor skills, (iii) consolidation of motor memories, (iv) inhibition of voluntary actions, (v) observation and mental imagery of motor sequences, and (vi) integration of sensory information.'
