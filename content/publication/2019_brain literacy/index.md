abstract: 'Walker and colleagues (2019) posited that brain literacy has the potential to help educators meet the needs of diverse learners. They considered three factors: (1) the foundations for incorporating neuroscience in professional educator development; (2) a brief review of the science of learning literature; and (3) the potential benefits of teaching practices informed by neuroscience knowledge compared to traditional teaching practices. They concluded with three strategies for developing brain literacy in educators, as a starting point for translating neuroscience knowledge into classroom practices.'
