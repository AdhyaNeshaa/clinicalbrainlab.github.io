## Description

[Complex Span](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan) is a [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) implementation of a working memory span task, adapted from [Gonthier et al. (2015)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0566-3).
Working memory is a critical component of human cognition and can be defined as the ability to store and process information simultaneously.

The task comprises of 2 components, the simple span and the complex span.
The simple span portion presents to-be-remembered consonants, where participants are prompted to type in the correct verbatim recall as each set size increases.
The complex span portion interleaves processing and recall tasks, where open-ended arithmetic operations are presented before to-be-recalled consonants are presented as each set size increases.


## Application

Complex Span is currently used in our lab to supplement the analysis of behavioural and neurocognitive correlates in the [Deception Project](/project/deception/).
