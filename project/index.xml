      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our research on biliteracy aims to better understand neural networks and the cognitive mechanisms underlying bilingualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measuring-the-brain-response-to-non-invasive-brain-stimulation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the brain response to non-invasive brain stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently in our lab, we are using fNIRS to explore changes in brain activity during brain stimulation and during cognitive tasks – i.e. reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain responses by recording changes in the amount of oxygenated/deoxygenated blood. It works based on the principle of light scattering – the device sends high intensity beams of near-infrared light at the scalp and detects changes to amount of light absorbed within the brain. Mathematical algorithms are then applied to process the collected data to calculate changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration. These changes are associated with changes in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project is activey looking for participants to take part!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inter-individual Differences in Deception Profile</title>
      <link>https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception-neuroscience/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While deception is considered as a common phenomenon with important implications, its conceptualization and study as a dispositional trait is under-represented in the literature. Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize individuals&amp;rsquo; lying patterns. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is pre-registered and currently submitted for review.&lt;/p&gt;
