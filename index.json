Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.","tags":["Deception"],"title":"The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596499200,"objectID":"004a3742f2b78b457f5bb2434d6d2079","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/post/dyslexia-biliteracy/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dyslexia-biliteracy/","section":"post","summary":"Looking for Chinese-English Bilinguals who had a history of dyslexia or are struggling in reading.","tags":[],"title":"Volunteers Needed!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mattan S.

While the Bayesian framework offers several alternative indices for the frequentist p-value, there is a lack of consensus and guidelines to help researchers decide which indices to use and understand the meaning of the values. Makowski and colleagues (2019) compared several Bayesian indices by simulating two widely used models in psychological sciences.

It works based on the principle of light scattering – the device sends high intensity beams of near-infrared light at the scalp and detects changes to amount of light absorbed within the brain. Mathematical algorithms are then applied to process the collected data to calculate changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration. These changes are associated with changes in brain function.\nOur project is activey looking for participants to take part!\nInvestigating the Bilingual Reading Network  Chinese-English Bilinguals who had a history of dyslexia or are struggling in reading  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d3ffcc0dfbe7331cf4f5e5ccb2fd9d6f","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/biliteracy/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/biliteracy/","section":"project","summary":"Our research on biliteracy aims to better understand neural networks and the cognitive mechanisms underlying bilingualism.","tags":["On-going projects"],"title":"Biliteracy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"26d00f757b906ff03020d0adf3aeb154","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/cerebellum/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cerebellum/","section":"project","summary":"We study cerebro-cerebellar pathways and their roles in higher cognition.","tags":["On-going projects"],"title":"Cerebellum and Cognition","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project, we seek to utilize neuroimaging to clarify the neural basis of cognitive and emotion processing in deception for potential application towards deception detection in a real-world setting. Neuroimaging research on deception has documented specific brain regions, and suggested potential neural network, associated with the cognitive processing of deception. However, limited research has examined the neural correlates related to emotion processing when one deceives. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there is limited research examining the neural network that could account for both cognitive and emotion processing in deception. Our first experiment will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address the present research gaps. The second experiment will use electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine brain activity associated with deception at high temporal solution. The third experiment will focus on developing and validating a Deception Scale that captures inter-individual differences in lying.\nInter-individual Differences in Deception Profile In this study, we established a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait, through developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire.

Unlike x-rays, which use ionizing radiation, fMRI images are generated from a strong magnetic field and low-power radio-waves. Therefore, there is no risk of exposure to radiation in fMRI.\nfMRI allows researchers to obtain images of brain activity over time, as participants complete various tasks. From these images, researchers get a better understanding of the brain areas that are involved in the tasks.\nEEG and Deception EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a neuroimaging technique used to measure electrical activity at the scalp that reflects the neural activity in the brain. It is a real-time recording of neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"97055070d28d45786814ee3a2b2a67bd","permalink":"https://clinicalbrainlab.github.io/project/deception-neuroscience/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deception-neuroscience/","section":"project","summary":"We use neuroimaging like fMRI, EEG, and physiological measures to understand the neural correlates of deception.","tags":["On-going projects"],"title":"Deception Neuroscience","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
